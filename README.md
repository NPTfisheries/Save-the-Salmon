Simple life-cycle models to predict future returns by turning the dials of controlling factors.

TODOS:
Create a one, or a series of stocastic models to predict future adult returns and effects of proposed conservation actions.


1. Capturing wild parr and rearing in a hatchery environment to offset natural rearing mortality. Use know hatchery survival numbers (99%) and a reduced smolt survival. Weighted for the proportion of the population pulled into the hatchery.
2. Life cycle model for entire Snake basin, using know survival parameters, and an assumed percentage increase from conservation actions in specific reach areas.
